INSTALL - Mirapoint::Admin Perl module for using the Mirapoint Administrative
	  Interface to Mail.

Copyright (C) April 2nd, 2001, Mirapoint Inc. <proserv@mirapoint.com>

Version: 2.4


Prerequisites
-------------

Perl 5.6 anything starting from perl 5.005 probably will work

For SSL Functionality:

	OpenSSL 0.9.6		(available from www.openssl.org)
	Net::SSLeay 1.25	(available from ftp.cpan.org)
	IO::Socket::SSL 0.96	(available from ftp.cpan.org)

Installing
----------

This release has only been tested on the following platforms:

	Perl 5.8 on Windows PC under Cygwin (non-SSL only)
	Perl 5.8.6 on Debian Linux Sarge

Other UNIX implementations are probably ok, although not tested nor
supported by Mirapoint Inc.

To Install:

	$ tar xzvf Net-MirapointAdmin-3.0.tar.gz 
	$ cd Net-MirapointAdmin-3.0
	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ su root
	# make install

If you wish to use the SSL functionality of the Net::MirapointAdmin module, 
then you must first install a working IO::Socket::SSL (which has Net::SSLeay 
as a pre-requisite).  If you are only handling cleartext connection, this
module is un-necessary.
